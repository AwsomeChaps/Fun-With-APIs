# Fun-With-APIs

The original premise was to compare weather and covid cases of glasgow on a graph however the only covid api that had data across a month that i could find stopped me from using it due to too many refreshes.

So now it is weather over a month, with a kanye west quote as the title :(

if the covid api was implemented then I would requeste the user to enter a month for which they want to see the weather compared to covid rates, however it is not worth it since its a rather useless program now
